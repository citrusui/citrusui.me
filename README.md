My minimal portfolio. Clean and simple.

There's a lot of tweaks and modifications to the Sass files, but for the most part, this site uses [Poole](http://getpoole.com).

# Scripts

`npm run dev`: Runs Jekyll as `development` and watches for any changes.

`npm run lint`: Lints all Sass files in `_sass` according to rules in `.sass-lint.yml`.

`npm run prepare`: Deploys to Firebase as production before publishing to npm. Requires npm@4.

`npm run prod`: Runs Jekyll with the `production` environment. This overrides `localhost` in favor of `site.url`.
