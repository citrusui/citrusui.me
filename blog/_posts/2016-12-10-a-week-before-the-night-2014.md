For the past few months, I've been listening to various vaporwave artists on Bandcamp, such as [Macintosh Plus (Vektroid),](https://vektroid.bandcamp.com/album/floral-shoppe) [Blank Banshee,](https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com) and [Saint Pepsi](https://saintpepsi.bandcamp.com/music) to name a few. I'm not going to go into detail about what vaporwave is — for that, I recommend you check out this [Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) Anyway, during my amazing discovery of vaporwave around October, I came across a song uploaded to YouTube by the name of [Resonance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GW6sLrK40k) As I do with any new song I like, I listened to it repeatedly (in this case, 20 times) before moving on. There was just so much emotion and feeling provoked from this one song — of which I craved more. However, since I was lazy, (and busy at the time) it wasn't until a few weeks later that I properly discovered the artist behind it all, [**HOME.**](https://www.facebook.com/homemusicofficial/)

HOME isn't vaporwave. [Or maybe it is.](https://www.facebook.com/homemusicofficial/posts/931648590278205) All I knew is that it sounded great. When I first discovered [Odyssey,](https://midwestcollective.bandcamp.com/album/odyssey) I again couldn't resist the temptation to press the play button over and over again. Eventually though, I did finally get the strength to move on, and went on a quest to search some other great music on Bandcamp.

Then, exactly a week ago (from the time of this writing), I found two other albums by HOME, [Before The Night](https://midwestcollective.bandcamp.com/album/before-the-night) and [Falling Into Place.](https://home96.bandcamp.com/album/falling-into-place) Why I looked over these is beyond my comprehension. It had me think, "Where has this been all my life? Why did nobody tell me about this?" and, "What's next?". A small part of me was glad that I waited this long, as I could now binge all the albums at once, but the other part was upset that I hadn't discovered HOME earlier.

Intentional or not, I love how individual the songs are. Though most people will play each song in order, I found that you don't have to. You can shuffle a single album or even mix-and-match songs between albums and still find the music to be just as pleasant.

I was going to write a short story beside each track in _Before The Night_, but I quickly realized how time-consuming that would be. Besides, the beauty of music is its subjective nature. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

I've embedded the album so you can listen for yourself. Keep in mind that you're going to need headphones at max volume to get the full experience. Sit back, relax, and free up an hour or so in your schedule. It's going to be a while.

In brief, Before The Night is by far my all time favorite album by HOME. It may not be as classic as Odyssey, nor as shiny as Falling Into Place, but it evoked the most emotion out of me. I felt invigorated, melancholy, and exhausted all throughout the entirety of this album. Though the songs will remain the same, what you make of it is all up to you.

You can support HOME (which I highly recommend) by purchasing and/or streaming through [Bandcamp,](https://home96.bandcamp.com) [iTunes,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/home/id1094887965) [Spotify,](https://play.spotify.com/artist/2exebQUDoIoT0dXA8BcN1P) [Play Music,](https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Home?id=Aczvgmwpheqthbzxhonkhixkf7e) and [SoundCloud.](https://soundcloud.com/home-2001) If you love the sound of electronic, low-fi, and retro instruments, this is the music for you.  Perhaps one day we'll get the chance to see (and hear) HOME tour live. It would be a dream.
