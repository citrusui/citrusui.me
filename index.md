# Avery Magnotti

Hi, I'm citrusui! I love making websites with modern technologies.

### About

While the bulk of my experience is in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am also well-acquainted with Ruby, PHP, Shell, and Perl.

### Get in touch

If you can, please donate to keep this site alive. Domains and hosting are not cheap.
